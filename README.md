### Hi Y'all ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year Masters student in the Masters in Data Science program at Columbia University. I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the Healthcare industry.

Before starting my Masters, I graduated from The George Washington University in Washington, DC, with a BS in Business Analytics and a minor in Computer Science in May 2022. After graduating, I worked at IBM as an Associate Developer in the IBM Federal Consulting Group. 

I was awarded the NSF CISE Graduate Fellowship (https://www.nsf.gov/cise/CSGrad4US/) and currently applying to start my PhD in Computer Science Fall 2024.
