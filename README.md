### Hi Y'all ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a first-year Masters student in the Masters in Data Science program at Columbia University. I am interested in the intersection of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the Healthcare industry. 

I was awarded the NSF CISE Graduate Fellowship (https://www.nsf.gov/cise/CSGrad4US/) and currently applying to start my PhD in Computer Science Fall 2024.
