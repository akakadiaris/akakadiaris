### Hi Y'all ðŸ‘‹

I graduated in May from the Master's in Data Science program at Columbia University. My academic focus is on the intersection of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in the healthcare industry, where I aim to leverage data-driven technologies to solve critical healthcare challenges.

Before starting my Masterâ€™s, I graduated from The George Washington University in Washington, DC, in May 2022 with a BS in Business Analytics and a minor in Computer Science. After graduation, I worked as an Associate Developer in the IBM Federal Consulting Group, where I gained hands-on experience in developing data solutions for clients across various sectors, including government.

I was honored to receive the NSF CISE Graduate Fellowship (https://www.nsf.gov/cise/CSGrad4US/) to support my graduate studies and research. As part of my future plans, I am currently applying for a PhD in Computer Science starting in Fall 2025.
